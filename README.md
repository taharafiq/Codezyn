# Codezyn 

Codezyn is an HTML/CSS generator which I wrote as a proof-of-concept for an undergrad Compiler Construction class. It takes input in the form of a template file, that defines the structure and design of the webpage, and a generator file that defines the content. Codezyn has been developed in Python using [SPARK](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/spark/). It is necessary to have Python installed to run Codezyn.

## Examples

The 'examples' directory contains example template and generator files. To run the examples, navigate to the folder containing the project and run the following command: 

`python CodezynRun.py examples/{NAME_OF_TEST_WITHOUT_EXTENSION}`
